This project aims to provide the user with a variant of the Wordle game model, however while also engaging the user intellectually by answering yes or no questions about the nature of the word
For Example:
If the word is "Elephant", the user can ask yes or no questions while at the same time configuring his guesses to match the number of letters in the words
